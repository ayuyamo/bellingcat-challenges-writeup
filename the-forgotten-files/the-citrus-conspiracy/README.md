# The Citrus Conspiracy

## Challenge Description

In 1972 an FBI informant shared details about the Lemon Tree, a club in Dallas (Are you sure that’s the right name? Ed.) Later that year, the club would be the site of a gangland killing.

Clues to old mysteries can lie deep within government documents. Over time, some of these documents may be declassified, uploaded online and even indexed by search engines. When combined with other open sources like archived news stories and geospatial tools, we can often bring more texture to historic events.

What was the club’s phone number and what neighbouring business is still there today (use the format XXX-XXXX business)?

## Searching Process

I started with searching up on Google with the query: `"1972" "FBI" "Lemon Tree" "Dallas" gangland killing`. The top result pointed to a [7-page long pdf document](https://www.archives.gov/files/research/jfk/releases/docid-32317121.pdf) containing snippets of FBI reports that were released under the **John F. Kennedy Assasination Records Collection Act of 1992**. At page 6, the "source" mentioned someone referred to as `Stanley the Creeper`, who was said to "[have] an interest in either the lemon tree or lemon twist, a club in Dallas." This information was reported in an FBI memorandum that was written and filed on November 14, 1972, which aligns with the year of the "gang killing" that occurred at the Lemon Tree (Twist) club, as noted in the challenge description.

With this new finding, I searched for the name "Stanley the Creeper" and found [this article](https://www.dmagazine.com/publications/d-magazine/1975/july/the-meanest-bars-in-dallas/) published by _D Magazine_ on July 1, 1975, titled "The Meanest Bars in Texas." In the first paragraph under the "Has-Beens and Overrateds" subsection, I found information about the **Lemon Twist** club, located at "4305-A Lem-mon Avenue," where Dixie Mafia member Stanley Lee Cook, also known as Stanley the Creeper, was killed by a sniper outside the bar. I then looked up the location on Google Maps and confirmed that the bar is no longer there.

Next, I searched for `Lemon Twist Dallas` to find the phone number of the bar and found this telephone directory containing business names, addresses and phone numbers in Dallas called [_Greater Dallas Yellow Pages_](https://texashistory.unt.edu/ark:/67531/metapth1763622/m1/139/), available on the Portal to Texas History website. On page 1437, I found the entry "Lemon Twist 4305-A Lemmon" under Night Clubs-(Cont'd) Section, followed by the phone number `526-1190`, which is the first part of the answer I was looking for.

I went back to Google Map to search for neighboring businesses near the location where Lemon Twist once operated, and there were several names popping up within the same building at 4305 A Lemmon Ave, Dallas. The nearest one is a KFC located in an adjacent building at 4303 Lemmon Ave, Dallas, TX 75219, and it's currently in operation.

I then searched for when this specific KFC location was opened to confirm that it had been operating since around the time the Lemon Twist was active, and one of the top Google search results led me to a directory on the [Texas Comptroller of Public Accounts website](https://mycpa.cpa.state.tx.us) listing business locations for the taxpayer KFC NATIONAL MANAGEMENT COMPANY. There, I found the an entry for 4303 Lemmon Ave marked as inactive, with a permit period from 10/01/1971 to 12/11/2002. With this it is confirmed that the location was opened around the time the Lemon Twist bar was still active, but I needed to verify that the said KFC location is still in operation (since Google Map information could sometimes be outdated).

I went back to the homepage of the Texas Comptroller of Public Accounts website and used the search function with the business name and zipcode as inputs (`KFC 75219`), which returned 3 results, one of which showed an active permit for the location in question. Upon clicking that result, the link redirect me to another page listing taxpayer locations for KFC CORPORATION, where I found "KFC CORPORATION #351065" at 4303 Lemmon Ave, active since 06/04/2024.

Based on this, I concluded that the same KFC location has likely been operating continuously from around 1971 to the present, with management changing between different LLCs or corporations over time. I submitted the final answer as `526-1190 KFC` and it was the correct answer.
